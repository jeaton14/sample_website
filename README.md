<p><center>This website is a sample website built by UCSD undergraduate research assistants for Ed Vul's Computational Cognition Lab. We seek to find new information on cognition using probabilistic models. We are using this website to survey the affects of a cognitive term called "signaling" and its effects on consumer behavior and interpersonal perception.</p><br><br>
