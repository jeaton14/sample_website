	Consent to act as a research subject</h1>
	<p>  Edward Vul, Ph.D. is conducting a research study to find out more about attention, distraction and learning.
            You have been asked to participate because you are an undergraduate here at UCSD. <br><br>
            PROCEDURES. If you agree to participate in this study, the following will happen to you:<br>
            1. You will sit at the computer and see displays of letters, words, or pictures.<br>
            2. You will try to perceive and remember these stimuli, and respond by pressing keys or saying things in
            a manner that the computer will describe to you.<br><br>
            RISKS. No potential risks or discomforts are anticipated except for the possibility that some tasks may be
            slightly boring.<br><br>
            PAYMENT/REMUNERATION. In consideration of your time and inconvenience, you will receive 1 hour of course credit. The procedures and length of participation will last approximately one hour.<br><br>
            RIGHTS. You may call the UCSD Human Research Protection Program at 858-657- 5100 to ask about your rights as a research subject or to report research-related problems.<br><br>
            BENEFITS. There will be no direct benefit to you from these procedures. However, the investigator may learn more about basic questions pertaining to memory, perception, cognition, and learning. This knowledge may have benefits to society in fields ranging from education to design of airplane cockpits, but these benefits will be indirect.<br><br>
            EXPLANATION. The researcher has explained this study to you and answered your questions. If you have questions or research related problems, you may reach Edward Vul at 858-534- 4401.<br><br>
